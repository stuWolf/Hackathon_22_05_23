## Purpose, Goals:   
Create a  Clock and Weather app. Nothing super new, but I just want to go through all process steps:
 - development
 - deployment
 - presentation                                     
 
 
 
 
 This example is drawn from  in T3/WK6 class /state model. It is a bit old, so we converted  it to functional elements,  more modern react. 
 
 ## Todo: 
 
 Integrate Weather function
 Fix season dependant Display
 Create Build and first Deploy
